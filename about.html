            <p class="white">
                I am currently a Technical Support Specialist by trade, working with schools in the UK for a websites provider,
                and regularly help maintain and update websites using HTML and CSS, some SQL, and helping to set up APIs - amongst other things.<br/>
                <br/>In addition to this, I have the ambition of becoming a developer and have recently enrolled on a course that will help me achieve
                this, and become a BCS-accredited developer.

            <h2 class="black">My Skills</h2>
            <p class="white">
            My working life began with my first full-time role as an apprentice
            Support Specialist for a start-up School Management Information Systems company called Pupil Asset, located
            in Norwich. <br/>There, I had my first experience of coding languages and had my introduction
            to HTML and CSS, which I used to edit report templates for customer use, and became a go-to within the team.<br/><br/>
            Since then I have moveed into a more technical role after Pupil Asset became a part of Juniper Education, and working
            with HTML, CSS and - to a lesser extent - JavaScript have become part of my day-to-day responsibilities. Naturally, in a customer-facing
            role, I have also worked on my relationship management and timekeeping skills, as well as developing a knack for
            explaining relatively complex matters in layman's terms to be more easily understood.

            <h2 class="black">My Hobbies</h2>
            <p class="white">
                I am a lifelong supporter of Norwich City Football Club and have been a season ticket holder since I was 16, spending most of
                my weekends following the club. <br/><br/>I'm passionate about motor racing and have spent much of my life watching Formula 1 (as a long-suffering fan of McLaren), and 
                other forms of motor racing including Super GT; MotoGP; DTM; British Touring Cars and the World Endurance Championship - famous for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.<br/><br/>
                Aside from these I also increasingly fail to find time to make my way through my reading list, although I've found more time in recent years for cooking, baking and to
                become somewhat of a coffee snob!
